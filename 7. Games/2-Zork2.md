## Overview
A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says, "I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on trespassers, but for a small fee, I'll show you the way out". You notice the gnome nervously glancing at his watch. Looks like he needs an XTERM environmental variable, a TTY and stdin to attach.
